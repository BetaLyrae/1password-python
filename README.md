# 1Password Python Client

This is a very brief client that was written to integrate into some projects used internally and the existing clients just didn't work for us in the way that we would expect.



## Installation

This project has not been added to PyPi yet. Please do not use it yet, as it is in development still. 
## Run Locally

You will need to get 1password UI up and running and enable integration with the 1password-cli. We do not want to have to work with your credentials. Native integration is the way forward and most secure form for us all.
